Role & Subject: A massive, encyclopedic 16:9 3D infographic poster titled "THE EVOLUTION OF STARK INDUSTRIES IRON MAN SUITS". The visual style is a high-end fusion of museum-grade product photography and complex technical engineering blueprints.

The Hero Lineup (Chronological Core): A complete, linear chronological lineup of 10 historical versions of Iron Man Armors, ranging from the crude, bulky Mark I prototype forged in a cave to the sleek, bleeding-edge Mark LXXXV nanotechnology model. They are arranged with precision on a glowing holographic measurement scale/ruler base running horizontally across the center. Rendering: Hyper-realistic 3D, 8k resolution. Emphasis on the evolution of textures: showing the aging of early crude welded scrap metal, heavy iron, and exposed wiring of the Mk I vs. the pristine, highly-polished hot-rod red and gold plating, and fluid nanotech finish of modern versions like the Mk 50 and Mk 85.

Brand Atmosphere (The Canvas): Background: A deep, rich Hot Rod Red and metallic Gold textured background, resembling an armored plating surface. It is heavily layered with low-opacity watermarks of vintage Stark Industries patent drawings, handwritten engineering notes by Tony Stark (with coffee stains), and newspaper clippings related to the Avengers' history. Header: A prominent, high-contrast STARK INDUSTRIES logo displayed at the top center, with a bold typography title.

Dense Annotation Network: Hundreds of fine white and cyan hairlines connecting specific components (e.g., Arc Reactors, Repulsor Transmitters in palms, Articulated Helmet Faceplates, Micro-missile Compartments, Flight Stabilizers) to compact text blocks, energy output charts, and data tables floating in the volumetric space.

Contextual Zones: "Era Modules" floating above the suits, representing different phases (e.g., "AFGHANISTAN ESCAPE," "THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE," "ULTRON OFFENSIVE," "INFINITY WAR NANO-TECH") with iconographic markers.

Magnifying Inserts: Circular "Zoom-in" lenses scattered in empty spaces, showing extreme macro close-ups of texture details like the crude welding on Mark I, the mechanical joint articulation of Mark III, and the fluid nano-particle assembly of Mark LXXXV.

Tech Specs Strip: A structured data bar at the very bottom listing precise specifications (Model Number, Weight in tons/kg, Power Source Type, Year of Creation, Primary Material Code).

Technical Specs: Octane render, Unreal Engine 5 aesthetic, editorial layout, information design masterpiece, cinematic volumetric lighting, sharp focus, professional color grading, blockbuster movie poster vibe. --ar 16:9 --v 6.0 --stylize 350
