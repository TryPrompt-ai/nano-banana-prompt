Level 3: People are better than others

Research filling criteria: excellent choice, online taste, the backbone of the product that will definitely not make you lose money after buying/watching it, which represents a certain degree of connoisseurship.

Visual representation: located in the middle level. The color palette is bright, clean lemon yellow and cool gray. The design style is modern and refreshing. Display representative high-quality middle-class products.

Level 4: NPC

Research filling criteria: products with a public face that have no memorable points, industrial assembly line products that are just a few, have no merit and are easy to be forgotten. The specific product or brand or person’s name must be written and do not be vague.

Visual presentation: located in the lower middle level. The shades are bland bread/beige or cardboard brown. Modular design appears ordinary, repetitive and lacks personality. Showcasing products that are very mediocre.

Level 5 (bottom level): Finished

Survey filling standards: The recognized "lightning rods", "IQ tax", catastrophic failure products or even existence that is worse than nothing found in the survey must be written with the specific product or brand or the name of the person without being vague.

Visual performance: squeezed at the bottom or corner of the screen, the visual space is compressed. The color tone is hopelessly black and pale, with obvious digital glitches, broken or decayed visual effects. Display products that are known to have flipped over, along with warning phrases (e.g., "Run away," "Big mistake").

**Prompt:**

```
Role & Subject: A massive, encyclopedic 16:9 3D infographic poster titled "THE EVOLUTION OF STARK INDUSTRIES IRON MAN SUITS". The visual style is a high-end fusion of museum-grade product photography and complex technical engineering blueprints.

The Hero Lineup (Chronological Core): A complete, linear chronological lineup of 10 historical versions of Iron Man Armors, ranging from the crude, bulky Mark I prototype forged in a cave to the sleek, bleeding-edge Mark LXXXV nanotechnology model. They are arranged with precision on a glowing holographic measurement scale/ruler base running horizontally across the center. Rendering: Hyper-realistic 3D, 8k resolution. Emphasis on the evolution of textures: showing the aging of early crude welded scrap metal, heavy iron, and exposed wiring of the Mk I vs. the pristine, highly-polished hot-rod red and gold plating, and fluid nanotech finish of modern versions like the Mk 50 and Mk 85.

Brand Atmosphere (The Canvas): Background: A deep, rich Hot Rod Red and metallic Gold textured background, resembling an armored plating surface. It is heavily layered with low-opacity watermarks of vintage Stark Industries patent drawings, handwritten engineering notes by Tony Stark (with coffee stains), and newspaper clippings related to the Avengers' history. Header: A prominent, high-contrast STARK INDUSTRIES logo displayed at the top center, with a bold typography title.

The "Hyper-Dense" Information Layer (The PUNCH Style): The layout is overwhelmed with organized information (creating a "Data aesthetics" look):

Dense Annotation Network: Hundreds of fine white and cyan hairlines connecting specific components (e.g., Arc Reactors, Repulsor Transmitters in palms, Articulated Helmet Faceplates, Micro-missile Compartments, Flight Stabilizers) to compact text blocks, energy output charts, and data tables floating in the volumetric space.

Contextual Zones: "Era Modules" floating above the suits, representing different phases (e.g., "AFGHANISTAN ESCAPE," "THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE," "ULTRON OFFENSIVE," "INFINITY WAR NANO-TECH") with iconographic markers.

Magnifying Inserts: Circular "Zoom-in" lenses scattered in empty spaces, showing extreme macro close-ups of texture details like the crude welding on Mark I, the mechanical joint articulation of Mark III, and the fluid nano-particle assembly of Mark LXXXV.

Tech Specs Strip: A structured data bar at the very bottom listing precise specifications (Model Number, Weight in tons/kg, Power Source Type, Year of Creation, Primary Material Code).

Technical Specs: Octane render, Unreal Engine 5 aesthetic, editorial layout, information design masterpiece, cinematic volumetric lighting, sharp focus, professional color grading, blockbuster movie poster vibe. --ar 16:9 --v 6.0 --stylize 350
